# Background Context
Welcome to a project that will challenge your understanding of programming and designing user interfaces, and displaying game information to the user during play sessions. User Interface (UI) is the bridge between the player and the game, and a well-designed UI enhances the player’s experience by making the game more intuitive and enjoyable.

This project will guide you through the process of creating and managing UI in Unity. You will learn how to import images for use in the UI, create and manage a canvas, use sprites, and create interactive UI elements such as sliders and toggles. You will also learn how to use PlayerPrefs to store and retrieve data between game sessions.

Upon completion of this project, you will have a solid understanding of Unity’s UI system, and you will be able to create and manage UI for your own games.

Are you ready to bridge the gap between the player and the game?

# Technical Description
This project focuses on the following key areas:

Importing Images: Learn how to import images to use in a user interface.
Canvas Management: Understand what a canvas is and the difference between Screenspace, Worldspace, and Localspace.
Sprites: Learn what a sprite is and how it differs from a texture. Learn how to use the Sprite Editor and what 9-slicing is.
Interactive UI Elements: Learn how to create a Slider and a Toggle, and how to swap button images.
PlayerPrefs: Understand how to use PlayerPrefs and what they are used for.
Please create a separate Unity project under the holbertonschool-unity repo, naming it unity-assets_ui. Please also include the latest TextMeshPro package (this project was made with 3.0.6) found in Package Manager -> Unity Registry -> TextMeshPro.

Note: Using free or paid script assets from the Unity Asset Store or elsewhere is prohibited for this project. Focus on creating your own scripts that interact with Unity’s existing character controller components.

The final product after the next few projects will function like this: Platformer - Final

At the end of this UI project, we will be at this stage in development: Platformer WIP - Assets: UI

UI design is an entire skillset in and of itself; designing and programming effective and well-engineered user interfaces is a skill that comes with practice and experience. Take advantage of existing UI design articles and studies to learn what works and what doesn’t, as well as what to keep in mind when you are creating user interfaces. The more UI designs you create, the easier the process will become.
